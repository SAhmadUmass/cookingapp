## Risk Management

### Technical Risks
- **API Limitations**: YouTube/TikTok may change their APIs or terms of service
  - *Mitigation*: Implement multiple extraction methods and regular monitoring
  
- **LLM Costs**: High usage could lead to significant API costs
  - *Mitigation*: Implement caching, optimize prompts, consider local models

- **Voice Recognition Accuracy**: Kitchen environments can be noisy
  - *Mitigation*: Implement confirmation steps, visual feedback, and error recovery

### Project Risks
- **Scope Creep**: Feature requests may expand beyond initial scope
  - *Mitigation*: Maintain strict prioritization and MVP definition
  
- **Integration Complexity**: Multiple systems need to work together seamlessly
  - *Mitigation*: Early integration testing, clear interface definitions

## Success Criteria
