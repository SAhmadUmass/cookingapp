# Cooking Assistant App - Project Overview

## Introduction
The Cooking Assistant App is an interactive mobile application that transforms cooking videos from platforms like YouTube and TikTok into guided, voice-interactive cooking experiences. Users can paste a video URL, and the app will analyze the content, extract the recipe, and create a voice agent that guides users through the cooking process step by step.

## Core Features
- **Video Content Ingestion**: Process YouTube and TikTok URLs to extract video content
- **AI-Powered Analysis**: Use LLMs via LangChain to extract and structure recipe information
- **Voice Interaction**: Provide a hands-free cooking experience with voice commands and responses
- **Step-by-Step Guidance**: Break down recipes into manageable steps with voice guidance
- **Contextual Understanding**: Allow users to ask questions about ingredients, techniques, or substitutions

## Technical Architecture

### Frontend (React Native/Expo)
- URL input interface
- Voice interaction UI
- Recipe visualization
- Progress tracking

### Backend Services
- Video processing pipeline
- LangChain orchestration
- Session management
- User data storage

### AI Components
- Video transcription
- Recipe extraction
- Conversational agent
- Text-to-speech and speech-to-text

## User Flow
1. User pastes a YouTube or TikTok URL
2. App processes the video and extracts recipe information
3. Voice agent initializes and introduces the recipe
4. User interacts with the agent through voice commands
5. Agent guides user through each step of the recipe
6. User can ask questions, request repetitions, or skip steps

## Technology Stack
- **Frontend**: React Native, Expo
- **Backend**: Node.js
- **AI/ML**: LangChain, OpenAI/Anthropic LLMs
- **Voice**: Expo Speech, React Native Voice
- **Video Processing**: YouTube API, custom scrapers

## Development Approach
The project follows an iterative development approach with continuous integration and testing. We prioritize core functionality first (video processing, basic voice interaction) before adding enhanced features and optimizations.

## Success Metrics
- Voice recognition accuracy
- Recipe extraction accuracy
- User completion rate
- Average interaction time
- User satisfaction ratings
